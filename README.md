# Maintenance Mode Plugin v0.1
This WordPress Plugin allows you to put the website under maintenance mode and preventing search engines and visitors from accessing the website.

This plugin, is useable in it current form, and will be updated along the way, feel free to fork or contribute. I am planning on making it an ongoing project and maybe submit it to the plugin directory as a free alternative to current premium plugins.
